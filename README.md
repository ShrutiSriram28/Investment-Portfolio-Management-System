# Investment-Portfolio-Management-System
The Investment Portfolio Management System calculates the asset value per day and the overall gain taking into account the invested amount, the price for the day, net asset value, time period, and so on. The investors can update their portfolio with what they have purchased or sold once they log into the account. The investors can hold three types of accounts - an individual account, a group account, or a joint account. An individual account can be viewed only by the person holding it. A group account lets the admin view the profiles of everyone in the group but the other account holders can only view the overall gain and their own profiles. A joint account allows all the account holders to observe othersâ€™ profiles along with theirs. In all cases, investment managers are given access to the profiles of their clients. They can oversee the gains and losses in real-time. The system mainly monitors the values of instruments such as shares held in stocks, mutual funds, ULIP, and bullion. The investors can request the investment managers to propose instruments to buy or sell. The investment managers can view the profile and current standings and give suggestions or make the transaction and update the profile. The project aims to facilitate the cumbersome process of keeping track and calculating the realized and unrealized gains of assets and also interact with the investment managers to further the gains.
